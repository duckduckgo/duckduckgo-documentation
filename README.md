# DuckDuckGo-Documentation

This will eventually be the central repository for all DuckDuckGo Documentation.

Currently, this houses the [DuckDuckHack](http://duckduckhack.com) documentation. If you've come here from our DuckDuckHack [documentation site](https://dukgo.com/duckduckhack/ddh-intro), feel free to look around in the `/duckduckhack` folder. If you've noticed any typos please make a GitHub issue, or go ahead and make the changes and submit a Pull Request.

Any feedback or thoughts about the documentation are welcome, **please** let us know at open@duckduckgo.com

Thanks!
