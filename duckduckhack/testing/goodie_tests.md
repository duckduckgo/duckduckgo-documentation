## Goodies Tests

For this example, we will look at the test file of the **RouterPasswords** Goodie, which is `t/RouterPasswords.t` [(link)](https://github.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-goodies/blob/master/t/RouterPasswords.t).

<!-- /summary -->

Good test files can help you quickly test code changes. They also serve as a functional specification for your code. This specification helps everyone quickly understand and verify the expected behavior of the code, improving the quality of the feedback you receive and accelerating the review process. [Test files are explained in detail over here.](https://github.com/duckduckgo/duckduckgo-documentation/blob/master/duckduckhack/testing/test_files.md)
