# Testing with the Location API

To write a test for a location-aware instant answer, you'll need to pass the test function an extra parameter - a `DDG::Request` object, with the location specified. To do this, you'll need to `use DDG::Test::Location` and `use DDG::Request`. Here is a working annotated example excerpted from the **Goodie::HelpLine** test file `t/HelpLine.t`. The same process should be used for Spice.

Note that only a small set of locations are available to be simulated for testing. They are defined in [DDG::Test::Location.pm](https://github.com/duckduckgo/duckduckgo/blob/master/lib/DDG/Test/Location.pm#L18).


```perl
#!/usr/bin/env perl

use strict;
use warnings;
use Test::More;
use DDG::Test::Spice;

# These two modules are only necessary when testing with the Location API.
use DDG::Test::Location;
use DDG::Request;

ddg_spice_test(
    [qw( DDG::Spice::Snow )],
    # This optional argument to ddg_goodie_test is a DDG::Request object.
    # The object constructor takes two arguments of its own:
    # the query (usually specified in the test_zci),
    # and a location object - created by test_location (with a country code).
    DDG::Request->new(
        query_raw => "is it snowing?",
        location => test_location("de")
    ) => test_spice(
        '/js/spice/snow/'
        .'M%C3%B6nchengladbach%2C%20%20Nordrhein-Westfalen%2C%20%20Germany',
        call_type => 'include',
        caller => 'DDG::Spice::Snow',
    ),
    # The DDG::Request is used in place of a query string, and isn't necessary
    # to be used with every test passed to ddg_spice_test.
    'is it snowing in new york?' => test_spice(
        '/js/spice/snow/new%20york',
        call_type => 'include',
        caller => 'DDG::Spice::Snow',
    )
);

done_testing;
```
