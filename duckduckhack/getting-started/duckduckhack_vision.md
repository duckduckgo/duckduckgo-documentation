# DuckDuckHack Vision

**The goal of DuckDuckHack is to provide users with relevant and useful instant answers.** To make sure these instant answers are worthy of being displayed, there are a few conditions that every instant answer must meet:

1. **Better Than Links**.  
    Instant answers have to be better because they are always placed at the top of the search results. An example of a good instant answer is [Yummly](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=garlic+steak+recipe). It shows recipes and pictures of the food, which is often what the user is looking for with that type of query.

2. **No False Positives**.  
    A false positive is an irrelevant instant answer. Only return an instant answer when you know it is good--otherwise we shouldn't be showing it at all. For example, the [Quixey instant answer](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=flight+search+app) shouldn't show an answer for queries such as ["how to build a simple ipad app"](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=how+to+build+a+simple+ipad+app).

3. **Minimal Vertical Space**.  
    Only include the most important information and then offer the user to click through for more if needed.

4. **Consistent Design**.  
    In order to display instant answers, we have four different instant answer types: **Goodie**, **Spice**, **Fathead**, and **Longtail**. Although each instant answer type serves a different purpose, the instant answers they provide should look and feel similar. When in doubt, copy what already exists or ask us! We already have a few cool designs such as [this one](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=movies) and [this one](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=garlic+steak+recipe).

These four points encompass the basic idea behind our instant answers, but in order to thoroughly describe how instant answers should be designed, we've also written comprehensive [**DuckDuckHack Instant Answer Design Guidelines**](https://github.com/duckduckgo/duckduckgo-documentation/blob/master/duckduckhack/styleguides/design_styleguide.md). You should keep these guidelines handy and turn to them often while you create your instant answer to ensure your instant answer design is appropriate and meets our expectations.
