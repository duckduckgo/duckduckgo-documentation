## New? Make Your First Contribution Today

If this is your first time contributing to [DuckDuckHack](http://www.duckduckhack.com), you have two great ways to quickly make your first commit:

**1. Make a [Cheat Sheet](https://duck.co/duckduckhack/goodie_cheat_sheets)**

Cheat sheets are a super-easy way to contribute to the live DuckDuckGo AnswerBar very quickly, by editing a single file. Cheat sheets can be about anything, from Emacs and Vim to Game of Thrones house names or wine pairings.

**2. Create a simple, complete "Hello World" Goodie with our [Quick Start Tutorial](https://duck.co/duckduckhack/goodie_quickstart)**

This short tutorial will lead you through all the parts of building a full-loop Goodie. This is a perfect place to start if you have an idea for an original Instant Answer.

## Create a New Instant Answer

Once you're comfortable with the workflow and how Goodies work, we're excited to have you create your own original Instant Answer. 

**1. Choose an idea**

Bring your own idea, or check out the ideas forum - especially [top voted answer ideas](https://duck.co/ideas/status/3?table_lnKRpLENwO2NUmZUyukQpw_sort=votes). 

Think of the searches you do most often:

- What has always frustrated you about the results? 
- What do you wish "just worked?"
- Is there a website or source of data that would help answer most/all of those searches?

For additional inspiration, we recommend browsing examples of [live Instant Answers](https://duck.co/ia).

**2. Plan your implementation**

The first step is to research and plan your Instant Answer. Consider [the best way to implement](https://duck.co/duckduckhack/determine_your_instant_answer_type) your idea, and review the [docs and guidelines](https://duck.co/duckduckhack/ddh-intro) that apply.
	
**3. Involve us**

Before you start coding, [let us know your plans](mailto:open@duckduckgo.com). By involving us early we can provide guidance and potentially save you a lot of time and effort. Email us at [open@duckduckgo.com](mailto:open@duckduckgo.com) with what idea you're working on and how you're thinking of going about it.

In addition, we'll promptly set up a [central Instant Answer page](http://www.duck.co/ia) on the community platform so others can know you're working on it and how they can help you.

This sample will help you craft your message:

```text
To: open@duckduckgo.com
Subject: Awesome Instant Answer Idea

I'd like to make an Instant Answer to help people searching for <topic/subject>!
When someone searches for <your trigger idea>, it would be cool if they could see <your response idea>.
I'm going to accomplish this with a <Goodie/Spice/Fathead/Longtail> type Instant Answer.
This is the data source: <link, description, Perl module, etc.>.
This is the related Duck.co idea: <url, if applicable>.
This is my Github username: <username>.

Thanks!

PS: DuckDuckGo is awesome!
```

P.S. To see just how simple it is to contribute an Instant Answer, check out David Farrell's PerlTricks post: [Writing Instant Answers is Easy](http://perltricks.com/article/169/2015/4/20/Writing-DuckDuckGo-instant-answers-is-easy).

## Improve an Existing Instant Answer

Another great way to contribute is to improve an existing, live Instant Answer. It's a great way to get further acquainted with Instant Answers, as well as get implementation ideas. (Many contributors report completing their first fix within two hours of forking the repository!)

**1. Choose a "low-hanging fruit"**

We've made sure to identify these throughout our repositories for new contributors.

- [Goodie Low Hanging Fruit](https://github.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-goodies/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Low-Hanging+Fruit%22) ([Goodie docs](https://duck.co/duckduckhack/goodie_overview))
- [Spice Low Hanging Fruit](https://github.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-spice/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Low-Hanging+Fruit%22) ([Spice docs](https://duck.co/duckduckhack/spice_overview))

**2. Dive in**

Go ahead and comment on any issues you're interested in helping with. Let us know what you're thinking and if you'd like any help or guidance.
