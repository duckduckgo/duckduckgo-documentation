# DuckDuckHack: An Instant Answer for Every Search

DuckDuckHack is a place where anyone can start sharing and creating instant answers for DuckDuckGo. We want people to get a great search experience, and we believe that a big part of that is getting the right answers to any of their searches.

Quixey is one of the instant answers that was recommended to us by the community. It allows people to search for mobile apps without having to rummage through the links.

## Getting Involved

Whether you can code or not, there are many ways for you to make an impact. You can get started by suggesting new instant answers to the community, recommending better data sources for existing ones, or actually hacking away and making your own instant answer.

1. **Suggesting Instant Answer Ideas**

  On DuckDuckGo, searches such as ["what is the height of the eiffel tower"](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=what+is+the+height+of+the+eiffel+tower) will show you that it's exactly 1063 feet tall, while ["currently in theaters"](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=currently+in+theaters) will show you what's actually playing in nearby movie theaters.  We depend on suggestions from users like yourself to know what sort of useful instant answers you want from your search engine.

2. **Recommending Sources**

  Everyone has a favorite source for useful information (maybe it's IMDB for movies or Yelp for local restaurant information). One of the recommended sources for music information was Last.FM. Now it is used for [album searches](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=Dookie+album+by+greenday) on DuckDuckGo!

  Since not every idea comes with the best possible data source in mind, you can help us by leaving a comment with your favorite source recommendation.

3. **Hacking on Instant Answers**

  Instant Answers depend on awesome open source developers to both create and improve them. If you're a developer and you'd like to create a new instant answer (or improve [current ones](https://duckduckgo.com/goodies)), we will welcome your contributions!
