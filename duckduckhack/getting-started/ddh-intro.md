# DuckDuckHack: Toward Better Instant Answers!

DuckDuckGo users believe in better answers with fewer clicks. After all, why sift through a page full of links, when an answer is readily available?

At DuckDuckGo, our instant answers are always placed at the top of the results page; often providing exactly what you want without any extra clicks.

In the above example, Quixey was a source recommended by our community for searching mobile apps. Now, any time someone searches for apps on DuckDuckGo, we can show the Quixey results as an instant answer!

## Getting Involved

Anyone in the world can help improve the search experience on DuckDuckGo. Whether you can code or not, there are many ways for you to contribute. You can get started by suggesting new instant answers to the community, recommending better data sources, or actually hacking away on your own instant answer.

1. **Suggesting Instant Answer Ideas**

  On DuckDuckGo, searches like ["chicken souvlaki recipe"](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=chicken+souvlaki+recipe) will show you tons of great recipes, while ["currently in theaters"](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=currently+in+theaters) will show you what's actually playing in nearby movie theaters.  We depend on suggestions from users like yourself to know what sort of useful instant answers you want from your search engine.

2. **Recommending Sources**

  Everyone has a favorite source for useful information (maybe it's Rotten Tomatoes for movies or Yelp for local restaurant information). Our users concluded that SoundCloud was a great source for answers about music. Now it is used for [music searches](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=daft+punk+music) on DuckDuckGo!

  Since not every idea comes with the best possible data source in mind, you can help us determine the right place to find relevant answers. Simply leave a comment with your own source recommendation.

3. **Hacking on Instant Answers**

  Instant Answers depend on awesome open source developers to both create and improve them. If you're a developer and you'd like to create a new instant answer (or improve [current ones](https://duckduckgo.com/goodies)), we welcome your contributions!
