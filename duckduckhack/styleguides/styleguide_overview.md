# DuckDuckHack - Instant Answer Style Guide

At DuckDuckGo we aim to make our instant answers highly informative and simple to use. This means that only the most relevant information should be included in instant answer results and the user should be able to immediately understand what they are looking at.

We also strive to ensure all our instant answers are designed and built with a focus on consistency. This means we maintain certain visual aspects across all of our instant answers such as the fonts and colors used, as well as the layout and placement of common elements, like the maximize/minimize button. This helps instill a feeling of familiarity in our users when they come across new instant answers and also helps reaffirm the expected results of their actions, eg. all blue, underlined text should always open a link when the user clicks it

Furthermore, as a largely open-source project, we like to keep our code as consistent as our instant answers. This means all code should be formatted the same way and should look and feel as though it has all been written by the same person.

For more information on the look and feel of instant answers, please refer to our [Design Style Guide](https://github.com/duckduckgo/duckduckgo-documentation/blob/master/duckduckhack/styleguides/design_styleguide.md).
