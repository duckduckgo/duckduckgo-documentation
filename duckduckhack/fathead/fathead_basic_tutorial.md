This is a basic tutorial about how to add instant answer for query "***Hello world in C***" with DuckDuckGo in 10 steps!

# Fathead Tutorial

## Step 1

Clone the fathead repo from github with following command

```shell
$ git clone git@github.com:/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-fathead.git
```

## Step 2

We need to create a Perl file aka metafile (**HelloWorldInC.pm**) under **lib/DDG/Fathead** with basic 
details about the instant answer. For our "***Hello world in C***" example, basic metafile should look like 

```perl
# content of lib/DDG/Fathead/HelloWorldInC.pm 
package DDG::Fathead::HelloWorldInC;
use DDG::Fathead;

primary_example_queries "hello world in c";

secondary_example_queries
    "hello world c program",
    "hello world in c programming";
description "Hello World programs in C language";
name "HelloWorldInC";
source "GitHub";
code_url "https://raw.github.com/leachim6/hello-world/master/c/c.c";
topics "geek", "programming";
category "programming";
1;
```

## Step 3

Now create directory named **HelloWorldInC** under **share** directory.

```shell
$ mkdir -p zeroclickinfo-fathead/share/HelloWorldInC
```

## Step 4

Create a file **fetch.sh**. This shell script is invoked to fetch the data. 
For example, following script will retrieve the **c.c** file and place it under **download** directory

```shell
$ cat zeroclickinfo-fathead/share/HelloWorldInC/fetch.sh 
#!/bin/bash
wget --directory-prefix=download https://raw.github.com/leachim6/hello-world/master/c/c.c
```

Please ensure all tmp files created under **download** directory. Go ahead and execute the 
**fetch.sh** script like

```shell
$./fetch.sh
```

It should create a **c.c** file under **download** directory.

## Step 5 

Our objective is to parse the fetched data and create an output file (**output.txt**).
In order to parse, we write wrapper called **parse.sh** which will invoke the actual script
which can be written in your favorite language (.pl, .py, .rb, .js, etc)

```shell
$ cat zeroclickinfo-fathead/share/HelloWorldInC/parse.sh 
#!/bin/bash
python parse.py
```

## Step 6 

As we can see above, we have the wrapper script which simply invokes the following Python script, which will
read **download/c.c** and format it then write into **output.txt** file.

```python
# content of  zeroclickinfo-fathead/share/HelloWorldInC/parse.py 
#!/usr/bin/env python3
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
import  logging, os

class HelloWorldItem:
  def __init__(self, language, filename, source):
    self.language = language
    self.filename = filename

    source = source.replace('\\n', '~~~n')
    source = source.replace('\n', '\\n')
    source = source.replace('~~~n', '\\\\n')
    self.source = source.replace('\t', '\\t')

  def __str__(self):
    fields = [ "hello world (%s)" % self.language,
               "", # namespace
               "https://raw.github.com/leachim6/hello-world/master/c/c.c",
               "Hello World in %s (%s)" % (self.language, self.filename),
               self.source, # synopsis (code)
             ]

    output = "%s\n" % ("\t".join(fields))
    return output

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # setup logger
    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO,format="%(message)s")
    logger = logging.getLogger()
    
    # dump config items into output.txt
    with open("output.txt", "wt") as output_file:
        for filepath in os.listdir('download/'):
	    filepath =  os.path.join('download/',filepath)
            _,filename = os.path.split(filepath)
            language,_ = os.path.splitext(filename)

            with open(filepath, 'r') as f:
                source = f.read()
                    
            item = HelloWorldItem(language, filename, source)
            output_file.write(str(item))

    logger.info("Parsed domain successfully")
```

## Step 7

Now we will execute the Python script via wrapper like 

```shell
$ ./parse.sh 
Parsed domain successfully
```

It has created the final **output.txt** file.

## Step 8

The content of output file is

```shell
$ cat output.txt 
hello world (c)		https://raw.github.com/leachim6/hello-world/master/c/c.c	Hello World in c (c.c)	#include<stdio.h>\n\nint main(void) {\n\tprintf("Hello World\\n");\n\treturn 0;\n}\n
```

As we need to complete the tutorial in 10 steps here comes 

## Step 8.5 

:) You can commit this **output.txt** along with Perl,Bash script or Python (.pm/.sh/.py) files since **output.txt** is less than **1MB**. 

## Step 9

You can create optional **data.url** file which will point to URL that contains the data to process.
Thus you don't need to perform fetch operation (step 4).

## Step 10

You can add specific instruction or any dependencies on a file named **README.txt**.
The final structure of your **share/HelloWorldInC** should look like 

```shell
$ ls
data.url  download  fetch.sh  output.txt  parse.py  parse.sh  README.txt
```


That's it, go ahead, create a patch and sent it for review.
