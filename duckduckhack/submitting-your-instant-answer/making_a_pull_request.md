# Making a Pull Request

Now that you have completed the [developer checklist](https://dukgo.com/duckduckhack/developer_checklist) and added [Metadata](https://dukgo.com/duckduckhack/metadata) to your instant answer, you are ready to submit a pull request.

If you are not sure how to create a pull request, GitHub provides excellent [instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request).

The root of each repository contains a `pull_request_template` which includes the most common questions the team will have about your contribution. The contents of this file should be copied and pasted directly into the [description area](https://github-images.s3.amazonaws.com/help/pull_requests/pullrequest-description.png) of the GitHub pull request form. The completed template will help the community better understand your pull request and expedite the review process.
