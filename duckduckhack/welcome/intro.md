## Dive in and Improve a Live Instant Answer

We welcome new contributors to dive in and improve live Instant Answers. It's a great, hands-on way to learn how things work. 

We always make sure to identify "low-hanging fruit" for new community members to work on. You'll want to start by [setting up your development environment](#), and make use of the reference documentation.

Goodie Instant Answers are self-contained Instant Answers that run on the DuckDuckGo server.
