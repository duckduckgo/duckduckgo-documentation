# Overview

Goodies are Perl-only instant answers that can essentially be contained within one Perl function. They are evaluated on our servers and include no external calls to other services.

Some Goodies are extremely simple, such as the [Capitalize](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=capitalize+duckduckgo+instant+answers) Goodie, which simply uses the perl `uc` function to uppercase a string. However, Goodies have the potential to be extremely complex and powerful such as the [Calculator](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%28879+*+14%29+%2F+12) or [Timezone Converter](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=4pm+EST+to+GMT) Goodies.

If you're new to DuckDuckHack or Perl, writing a simple Goodie instant answer is probably the quickest and easiest way to get started with DuckDuckHack.

**\*\*Note:** Goodies ***cannot*** make HTTP requests
