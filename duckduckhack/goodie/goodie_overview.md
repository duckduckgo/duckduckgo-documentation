## Goodie Instant Answers

Goodies are pure-code Instant Answers. They are essentially a Perl function that is evaluated on our servers, and do not make external HTTP requests to other services.

Goodies can be extremely simple, such as the [Capitalize](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=capitalize+duckduckgo+instant+answers) Goodie, which simply uses the perl `uc` function to uppercase a string. 

Goodies can also be extremely complex and powerful such as the [Calculator](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%28879+*+14%29+%2F+12) or [Timezone Converter](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=4pm+EST+to+GMT) Goodies. Contributors have used Goodies to do additional cool things like [generate passwords](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=password+15+strong&ia=answer) and [create QR codes](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=qr+duckduckhack.com&ia=answer).

If you're new to DuckDuckHack or Perl, writing a simple Goodie Instant Answer is probably the quickest and easiest way to get started with DuckDuckHack.

**Note:** Goodies ***cannot*** make HTTP requests
