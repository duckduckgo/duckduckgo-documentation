# Goodie Instant Answers

Goodies are instant answers that are written in [Perl](http://www.perl.org/). These instant answers are mainly used for computing and displaying information. They are evaluated on our servers and make no external calls to other services. They are, however, allowed to read files.

Some Goodies are extremely simple such as the [Capitalize](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=capitalize+duckduckgo+instant+answers) Goodie, which simply uses the perl `uc` function to uppercase a string. However, Goodies also have the potential to be extremely complex and powerful such as the [Calculator](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%28879+*+14%29+%2F+12) or [Timezone Converter](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=4pm+EST+to+GMT) Goodies.

**Note:** Don't worry if you're new to Perl. You can learn more about it on [Learn Perl](http://learn.perl.org/). If you're interested, you can also watch Larry Wall's interview on [Big Think](http://bigthink.com/users/larrywall).
