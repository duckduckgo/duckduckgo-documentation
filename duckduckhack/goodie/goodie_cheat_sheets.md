# Goodie Cheat Sheets

A popular (and perfect) use of Goodies is to create cheat sheets which are available right from the DuckDuckGo search bar. To make adding a cheat sheet as quick as possible, we've brought all cheat sheets together under one Instant Answer, called the [Cheat Sheets Goodie](https://duck.co/ia/view/cheat_sheets).

## Cheat Sheet Ideas

A cheat sheet is not always the best representation for your data. Sometimes, an Instant Answer is better built as a full Goodie or another type of Instant Answer. When thinking about your cheat sheet idea, think about what is useful to a searcher. Keyboard shortcuts, video game cheat codes, and similar data can be wonderfully useful as a cheat sheet. Here are some other cheat sheet Instant Answers we love:

## How to Add Your Cheat Sheet

Once you have an [idea for a cheat sheet](#cheat-sheet-ideas), it's easy to add it to the DuckDuckGo Cheat Sheet Goodie. 

**The first step is to [set up your development environment](https://duck.co/duckduckhack/setup_dev_environment).** During setup [following the steps](https://duck.co/duckduckhack/setup_dev_environment) to set up your environment and choose the option to fork/clone the Goodies repository (where Cheat Sheets live). 

### Create a JSON File

After cloning the Goodies repository, you simply need to add **one JSON file** to the existing `/json` folder in the [Cheat Sheets share directory](https://github.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-goodies/tree/master/share/goodie/cheat_sheets/json).

To do this in Codio, use the left-hand panel to enter the `/zeroclickinfo-goodies` repository directory. Then use the file tree to click into the `/share/goodie/cheat_sheets` directory. Then click the **json** folder. 

Up in the **File menu**, click **"Create New File"**, and enter the name of your cheat sheet as a JSON file (make sure it's saving to the `cheat_sheets` directory). For example, if the trigger for your cheat sheet is "gopro cheat sheet" create a new file called `gopro.json`.

Erase any pre-filled contents, and enter the values for your cheat sheet using the [cheat sheet JSON syntax](#cheat-sheet-json-syntax). Feel free to copy the code in the following section into your new file as a convenient template.

Conveniently, with cheat sheets there's no need to create a new Instant Answer. There is also no need to edit the `CheatSheets.pm` file, `cheat_sheets.js`, or `cheat_sheets.css`. Simply save your new file, and proceed to test your work.

### Test Your Cheat Sheet

The next step is to test your code and make sure it works like you intended. To do this, we'll create a test server that will allow you to view your Instant Answer as it would appear above DuckDuckGo search results.

1. In Codio, open your Terminal by clicking on **Tools > Terminal**.
2. Change into the `zeroclickinfo-goodies` directory by typing `cd zeroclickinfo-goodies` at the command line.
3. Next, type **`duckpan server`** and press "**Enter**". The Terminal should print some text and let you know that the server is listening on port 5000.

    ```
    Starting up webserver...
    You can stop the webserver with Ctrl-C
    HTTP::Server::PSGI: Accepting connections at http://0:5000/
    ```

4. Click the "**DuckPAN Server**" button at the top of the screen. A new browser tab should open and you should see the DuckDuckGo Homepage. Type the name of your cheat sheet, plus **"cheat sheet"** and press "**Enter**".
5. You should see your cheat sheet show up in the search results! **Make sure it displays correctly; check that all escaped characters and code blocks appear as you intended.**
6. When you're done testing, go back to the Terminal, andpress "**Ctrl+C**" to shut down the DuckPAN Server. The Terminal should return to a regular command prompt.

When your cheat sheet works like you want it to, you're ready to submit your contribution.

### Submit Your Pull Request

Submitting your cheat sheet is similar to submitting any Instant Answer contribution. New code is submitted using pull requests on GitHub. To make a pull request, follow the [submission and review instructions](https://duck.co/duckduckhack/submission_and_review).

## How Are Cheat Sheets Triggered?

Triggering is built in to the main Cheat Sheets Goodie. When the name of your cheat sheet file is searched with any of the [built-in trigger words](https://github.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-goodies/blob/master/lib/DDG/Goodie/CheatSheets.pm), your Instant Answer will be shown. 

For example, for the *vim* text editor, the Instant Answer will be triggered on: 

- "vim *cheatsheet*"
- "vim *cheat sheet*"
- "vim *commands*"
- "vim *guide*"
- "vim *shortcuts*"
- ...and so on. View all terms in [CheatSheets.pm](https://github.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-goodies/blob/master/lib/DDG/Goodie/CheatSheets.pm). 

If you'd like to add more names for the subject of your cheat sheet (in addition to the file name), you can specify them in the `aliases` property of your cheat sheet JSON file. For example, if your cheat sheet file is `lord-of-the-rings.json`, a natural alias is 'LOTR'. For details check out the [Cheat Sheet JSON Reference](#cheat-sheet-json-reference).

## Cheat Sheet JSON Reference

Below is a summary of the [`vim.json`](https://github.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-goodies/blob/master/share/goodie/cheat_sheets/json/vim.json) file, which displays a cheat sheet when searching for ["vim cheat sheet"](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=vim+cheat+sheet&ia=answer).

![vim cheat sheet](https://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fduckduckgo%2Fduckduckgo-documentation%2Fmaster%2Fduckduckhack%2Fassets%2Fvim_cheat_sheet.png&f=1)

The above Instant Answer was created by simply adding [`vim.json`](https://github.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-goodies/blob/master/share/goodie/cheat_sheets/json/vim.json), explained below. 

**For convenience, we encourage you to copy the [`vim.json`](https://github.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-goodies/blob/master/share/goodie/cheat_sheets/json/vim.json) code into your new file, as a starting point.** Copy the [raw file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/duckduckgo/zeroclickinfo-goodies/master/share/goodie/cheat_sheets/json/vim.json), as the JSON below won't work due to inline comments.

            // ...additional entries

        // ...additional sections
    }
}
```

### Cheat Sheet Templates

We've seen a wonderfully wide variety of cheat sheets; we realized that one visual format doesn't fit all ideas. We've created an *optional* `template_type` property so you can pick the best look for your cheat sheet.

Here are the available `template_type` values:

- `keyboard` - the default (see it live at ["vim cheatsheet"](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=vim+cheatsheet&ia=cheatsheet))
- `terminal` - (see it live at ["git cheatsheet"](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=git+cheatsheet&ia=cheatsheet))
- `code` - (see it live at ["regex cheatsheet"](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=regex+cheat+sheet&ia=cheatsheet))
- `reference` - (see it live at ["wu-tang cheatsheet"](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=wu-tang+cheat+sheet&ia=cheatsheet))

![Cheat sheet template types](https://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fduckduckgo%2Fduckduckgo-documentation%2Fmaster%2Fduckduckhack%2Fassets%2Fcheatsheet-template-types.png&f=1)

### Syntax for `key` Property

Cheat sheet actions often have several key combinations, which you can indicate in the syntax of each `key` property.

**Brackets, `[ ]`, or braces, `{ }`, are used to wrap key combinations in code blocks.** For convenience, if you include no brackets or braces, the entire string will be shown in a code block.

*Note: It does not matter whether you use brackets or braces - they both wrap text in code blocks.*

#### Escaping Special Characters

Your cheat sheet might include characters which are themselves part of JSON syntax. To express these literally, escape them using backslashes, like [standard JSON](http://json.org):

- To express a double quote, use a single backslash: `\"`
- To express a forward slash, use a single backslash: `\/`
- For full list of characters, see the diagram on the right on [the official JSON documentation](http://json.org).

Because cheat sheets display brackets `[ ]` and braces `{ }` as code blocks, express those literally using a **double backslash**:

- If you want to express a literal bracket, use a double backslash `[Ctrl]  {\\[}`.
- If you want to express a literal brace, use a double backslash `[Ctrl] [\\{]`.
- To express a **single literal backslash**, type four backslashes in a row: `[Ctrl] [\\\\]`.

*Note that an uneven number of sequential backslashes will throw an error.*

### Formatting Key Presses

Cheat sheets often list key combinations, which you can express in any way you choose. The following are only suggestions; choose the appropriate convention for your subject.

#### Single Keys or Commands

There is no special syntax required for the string - for example, `"x"` or `":set color"`. The entire string will be shown in one code block.

#### Simultaneous Keys (e.g., pressing A and B together)

We recommend expressing simultaneous key presses as follows: 

- As adjacent code blocks, e.g. `"[Ctrl] [v]"`
- For "*nix-style" cheatsheets (like Emacs), as a single code block with a dash, e.g. `"[C-v]"`
	
#### Consecutive Keys (e.g., pressing A, then pressing B)

We recommend expressing consecutive key presses as separate code blocks separated by a comma, e.g. `"[Ctrl-B], [x]"`
	
#### Alternative Keys (e.g., pressing either A or B)

We recommend displaying alternatives as follows: 

- For single-key alternatives, wrap in parentheses, e.g. `[Ctrl] ( [L] / [P] )`
- For complete alternatives, we recommend replicating the key-value pair. Make an indication in the `val` that it's an alternative:
	
	```
	{
        "key": "[Ctrl] [j]",
        "val": "Jump"               
    },
	{
        "key": "[Ctrl] [Spacebar]",
        "val": "Jump (alternative)"               
    },
	```

#### Arrow Keys

We've found the best way to express arrow keys is directly using arrow ASCII characters (&larr;, &uarr;, &rarr;, &darr;). Feel free to copy and paste the characters from here.

For example, instead of **[Shift] [Up]** we recommend **[Shift] [&uarr;]**.
